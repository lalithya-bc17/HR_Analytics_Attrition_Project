## 🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting *employee attrition* using data analytics and machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to identify the key factors that lead employees to leave the organization and help HR departments take preventive actions.  
By analyzing HR data, this project provides insights to improve *employee satisfaction, **retention, and **productivity*.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze HR employee data and detect trends that influence attrition.  
- Build machine learning models to predict whether an employee will stay or leave.  
- Identify the most important features affecting attrition using SHAP analysis.  
- Present results through clean visuals and an easy-to-understand report.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- *Python 3* – Programming and analysis  
- *NumPy & Pandas* – Data preprocessing and manipulation  
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – Visualization and trend analysis  
- *Scikit-learn* – Building Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models  
- *SHAP* – Feature importance and model interpretability  
- *Google Colab* – Cloud environment for execution  
- *GitHub* – Version control and project portfolio hosting  

## 🧩 Steps Followed
1. Collected the *IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset* from Kaggle.  
2. Cleaned and encoded the dataset to prepare it for modeling.  
3. Performed *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to visualize key attrition patterns.  
4. Built and trained two models — Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.  
5. Compared model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.  
6. Applied *SHAP analysis* to interpret model predictions and feature importance.  

## 📊 Results & Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Key Insights |
|:------|:----------|:-------------|
| *Logistic Regression* | *87.8 %* | Most accurate and interpretable model |
| *Decision Tree* | *79.9 %* | Captures complex relations but slightly overfits |

### 🔍 Major Findings
- Employees with *low salary* and *low job satisfaction* are more likely to leave.  
- *OverTime* and *short tenure* have a strong positive relation with attrition.  
- Improving salary structure and promoting work-life balance can reduce turnover.
